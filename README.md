# Gradient Descent Algorithm

This project is an extra credit assignment for MATH 210, section 02 (spring 2023) at Chapman University.

# Running the Code

Start by creating and activating the Python virtual environment:

```
python -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
```

Install `numpy` and other dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, run each exercise like so:

```
python exercise1.py
python exercise2.py
python exercise3.py
```


# Results

## Exercise 1

In my testing, the final guess ends with something close to `(-0.8962922428213529, 0.14270553189951954)`. Plotted on a graph:
